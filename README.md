# Chipathon Proposal: Development of a 4-Input Multiplexer Standard Cell

## Project Overview

In this project, our team, Digimon, proposes the development of a **4-input multiplexer (MUX)** standard cell as part of the IEEE SSCS Chipathon 2025. The goal is to design, implement, and verify a robust and reusable MUX cell that can be integrated into larger digital logic designs, contributing to an open-source standard cell library for academic and prototyping use. This work will be conducted from June, 2025 to September, 2025 and will consist of 5 stages:

- Proposal Creation
- Schematic Design and Simulation
- Layout Design and Post-layout verificiation
- Standard Cell Characterization
- Manufacturing & Testing

## Functional Description

The **4-to-1 Multiplexer** has 4 data inputs (D0, D1, D2, D3), 2 select lines (S1, S0), and 1 output (Y).

| S1 | S0 | Y   |
|----|----|-----|
| 0  | 0  | D0  |
| 0  | 1  | D1  |
| 1  | 0  | D2  |
| 1  | 1  | D3  |

### Function:
Depending on the combination of select lines S1 and S0, the output Y will reflect the corresponding data input.
